Configure every vanilla compatible field in the game.

The main config has toggles for various presets (like enabling infinite fuel for fireplaces/lightsources or making build pieces indestructible/ignore rain damage).
For anything else you'll need to copy and edit `$(ValheimInstallDir)/BepInEx/config/ArgusMagnus.{PluginName}.Prefabs.default.yml` (see example below). This file is generated on startup
and contains all the available component-prefab combinations and their fields with default values. If the yml-file contains entries that conflict with a preset
set in the main config, the yml-file will win.

Omitting `PrefabNames` will apply the configuration to all prefabs of the specified component.

This mod is intentionally kept simple. If you want powerful scripting support, use Expand World Prefabs.
